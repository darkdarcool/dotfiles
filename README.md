# My dotfiles

The current state of my public dotfiles/nix configuration (this repo) is 
pretty bad currently. Not everything is migrated over to home-manager/nix, 
meanining that if you copied my system flake - nothing would work. Whenever
I finally get everything in here, I'll update this README with screenshots and 
extraneous information about the systems I configure and how I configure them.

In the meantime, feel free to just ask me a question via discord if you have 
any, or just go look at someone else's dotfiles. I'm sure they're better than
mine.
